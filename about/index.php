			<h3>Philosophy</h3>
			<p>I've always loved a good challenge and I take pride in my craft. I'm a firm believer that if you work hard, have faith in what you're doing and remain honest with yourself and others you can't go wrong. Calling this some sort of "design philosophy" sounds corny but the principles I carry with me in life translate to my work as well. In a team setting Iâ€™m driven to help make the group better in any way that I can and I prioritize reaching our collective goal as a team. Simplicity, curiosity, hard work and having fun are all things that motivate me on a daily basis.</p>
