			<h3>The "I'm Just a Dude in the World Version"</h3>
			<p>I've always loved a good challenge and I take pride in my work ethic. I'm a firm believer that if you work hard, have faith in what you're doing and remain honest (with yourself and others) things tend to work out. It's a bonus that you get there with your integrity intact. Calling this some sort of "design philosophy" sounds corny but the principles I bring with me in life certainly carry over to my work as well. In a team setting I'm more concerend with what I can do to help versus what I can do move myself up the ladder. Simplicity, curiosity, hard work and having fun are all things that motivate me on a daily basis.</p>
