					<h1>15 Years of DIY Shows</h1>

					<p>Since 1999 I have helped organize and promote over 275 all ages DIY shows in Massachusetts and around the country, with local, regional, national and international artists. Facilitating these community minded art and music events is something I've always felt passionately about, even as far back as high school. I'm thankful for growing up in a small mill town without a lot to do because this challenged friends and myself to make our own fun and to do something positive in our community. It was through these shows that I got my start designing and printing show posters and album art for bands.</p>

					<h3>The Old Store</h3>

					<p>Long time collaborator and my original design guru Mike Swiatlowski got the ball rolling in Palmer. His family owned a drug store for several generations and when the space went up for lease Mike was able to convince his folks to let the kids of Palmer get together for a show in the now empty space. This single show turned into 38 other events until the space was eventually sold. Amazing bands from all over the country like Converge, Atom and His Package and XBXRX passed through our small town to play The Old Store.</p>

					<h3>The Shed</h3>

					<p>A former tool shed turned into a practice space eventually turned into a show space shortly before The Old Store closed for good. Mike Swit and I teamed up full time to put on an average of 20 shows a year over a five year run in my mother's backyard. Bands from down the street played with bands from around the world, making for an eclectic mix of music that a hundred or more people would show up for and cram into our tiny shed to see.</p>

					<h3>The Recent Years</h3>

					<p>Shows typically happen between Boston and Palmer. Miscellaneous all ages spaces in Boston are home to our shows and Diamond Junction Bowling Lanes has become a pretty righteous partnership in Palmer. Since 2013 shows have been happening all over the country since <a href="/nationalposterretrospecticus">The National Poster Retrospecticus</a> has caught some momentum.</p>
