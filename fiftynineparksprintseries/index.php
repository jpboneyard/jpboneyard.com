					<h1>The Fifty-Nine Parks Print Series</h1>
					<p>This brand combines some of my favorite things: National Parks and screen printed posters! <a href="http://www.59parks.com" target="_blank">The Fifty-Nine Parks Print Series</a> is </p>

					<p>Touring around the country with The NPR has been one of the greatest adventures of my life. It is through this adventure that I am able to combine my design skills, show planning background, love for community based events, enthusiasm for travel and passion for posters into one amazing experience. I am also fortunate enough to meet some of the most genuine and kindest people while on the road—most of whom share the same enthusiasm for posters. This enthusiasm is like fuel that helps keep me going while we make those eleven hour drives through crazy weather and deserted stretches of highway, hang 300 posters and host a packed show for one-night-only in each city.</p>

					<h3>Art Direction</h3>
					<p>Retrospecticus is a funny word. The translation comes out to something along the lines of "to look forward" and "to look backward". Combine that with imagery from early American lore and we have the all seeing eye of providence. The brand is flexible enough to fit the needs of a 1" button, an extensive website, a poster series or a giant banner.</p>

					<h3>Production</h3>
					<p>The design for the website has evolved right along with the needs of the site. My first pass was just something to announce and document the second coming of the show in 2012. The second, third and fourth passes were ways to document the tours, do a little lifting in the marketing department and do a better job of explaining what the heck this crazy show is all about.</p>

					<h3>Design</h3>
					<p>This is where the heavy lifting comes in. Booking a cross-country art tour isn't standard fare—especially for one-night-only events. I've found that my previous experience booking bands came in handy. The logistical puzzle of booking consecutive shows, promoting each event across the interweb and in all of the local news and art publications can get heavy but I love digging into complex problems like this!</p>
