					<h1>Gig Posters</h1>
					<p>I got my start in design by meticulously crafting flyers and simple two color screenprinted posters coming out of high school. Posters will always be near and dear to me and I'll never forget that feeling of excitement I'd get after finishing some of my first posters. It felt triumphant and I love the sense of active meditaion that would grip me as I essentially became aware of my passion for design. It was through the necessity to promote the DIY shows I was setting up in the late 90's that I made my introduction the world of gig posters.</p>

					<h3>Elephant Six Orchestra</h3>

					<div class="overline">14 x 22" two color screen print</div>

					<p>It's rare that a DIY show in Western Mass sells out, but it totally happened here, and just weeks after pre-sale tickets hit the interwebs. Clearly this event was going to be a good time. The Holiday Surprise tour happened in Spring of 2011 and was a celebration of sorts because some of these bands rarely tour and because the Spring thaw was upon us.</p>

					<h3>Mount Eerie</h3>

					<div class="overline">15 x 23" one color screen print</div>

					<p>The unholy combination of Black Metal and Twin Peaks inspired the music that Mount Eerie was playing on this particular tour. The music was heavy, ominious and introspective. My goal for this print was to create the landscape that I pictured in my mind as these powerful tunes delighted my ears. This place lives in black and white with t.v. static in the sky.</p>

					<h3>Bikes Fight Cancer</h3>

					<div class="overline">15 x 22" two color screen print</div>

					<p>Since 2006 Team Palmer Pedal Power has helped raise over $75,000 for the Jimmy Fund and put thousands of miles on their bicycles in the process. This poster took inspiration from their slogan, "bikes fight cancer".</p>



					<img class="img-full full-m section-start" src="/_img/golden-girls-jp-boneyard.jpg" alt="Golden Girls Poster" />

					<h3>Golden Girls</h3>

					<div class="overline">13 x 19" one color screen print</div>

					<p>Golden Girls and Truman Peyoteâ€”two of the more interesting names to put on a poster. Inspired by those names and their mixed and matched / misappropriated nature, scanning, cutting and collaging was the method of attack for this project.</p>

					<h3>Jason Anderson</h3>

					<div class="overline">14 x 22" two color screen print</div>

					<p>Free popsicles, summer heat and the month our nation was born. Such a fun show. After two previous versions involving cool summer treats, this is where the poster landed. Don't fight it, feel it y'all!</p>



					<img class="img-full full-m section-start" src="/_img/oneida-jp-boneyard.jpg" alt="Oneida Poster" />

					<h3>Oneida</h3>

					<div class="overline">14 x 22" two color screen print</div>

					<p>Monsters, skateboarding and a healthy green glow. These are the things that come to mind when Oneida, Big Digits, Golden Girls, and Dom are put into a room together. The show was awesome and I hear one of these prints is hanging up in the corporate bathrooms of JP Licks, in Jamaica Plain, MA.</p>

					<h3>Mount Eerie</h3>

					<div class="overline">15 x 23" one color screen print</div>

					<p>Who's that creep in the backyard? Or is someone returning home after a weird walk in the woods? This show provided an opportunity to make something with less of an exuberant vibe compared to my other poster work. The source of inspiration was the darker, loungey, introspective themes provided by the bands on the bill. That and channeling my inner goth / watching 48 hours worth of film noir flicks. Also worth noting, this poster glows in the dork.</p>
