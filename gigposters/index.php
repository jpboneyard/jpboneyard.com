					<h3>Gig Posters</h3>

					<p>Since 1999 I have helped organize and promote over 250 all ages DIY shows in Massachusetts and around the country, with local, regional, national and international acts. People coming together through music and art is something I've always felt inspired by and love the sense of community that it brings. The shows we put together are all ages, bands receive 100% of the door money after venue costs, and we take nothing for ourselves I grew up in a small town without a lot to do by way of self expression and entertainment. Fortunately I was blessed to be surrounded by so many creative friends who were playing in bands (and needed a drummer, much like myself). Once the basement circuit rand its course we all need.</p>

					<h3>Elephant Six Orchestra</h3>

					<p>This self initiated project took place during my last semester at Mass Art. The goal of the project was to gain more experience drawing letter forms and experiment with screen printing. To prepare for the project I collected 945 letters as research, and built a new screen printing set up that would allow me to print twice as large as in the past. Type was then redrawn from reference, from scratch or left as is because it was so unique, and then screen printed. From start to finish this project took 200+ hours to complete — probably the most time I've spent on any one project to date!</p>
