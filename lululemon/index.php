					<h3>LuluLemon Wall Art</h3>

					<p>In Winter of 2012 Lululemon got in touch about creating a unique piece of wall art for their new store in Boston Mass. The slogan came from lulu's mission statement and the overall aesthetic was inspired by Newbury Street and the new space itself. As a take-away to hand out at the opening, I also screen printed a short run of posters. Seaport Graphics did an amazing job turning an old 9'x9' barn door into a rad sign and Nathan Legsdin documented the project.</p>

					<h3>Commemorative Poster</h3>

					<p>This self initiated project took place during my last semester at Mass Art. The goal of the project was to gain more experience drawing letter forms and experiment with screen printing. To prepare for the project I collected 945 letters as research, and built a new screen printing set up that would allow me to print twice as large as in the past. Type was then redrawn from reference, from scratch or left as is because it was so unique, and then screen printed. From start to finish this project took 200+ hours to complete — probably the most time I've spent on any one project to date!</p>
