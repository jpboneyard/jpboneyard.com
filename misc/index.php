					<h1>Misc Projects</h1>
					<p>Small side projects, freelance jobs or one-off pieces always find there way onto my radar in between working full time at <a href="/upstatement">Upstatement</a> and running <a href="/nationalposterretrospecticus">The National Poster Retrospecticus</a>.</p>

					<h3>The Everywhere Project</h3>
					<p><a href="http://been-everywhere.com/" target="_blank">The Everywhere Project</a> pays tribute to the classic folk song “I’ve Been Everywhere”. My birthplace of Springfield Mass is mentioned in the song and I was fortunate enough to represent the city and hang with a pretty righteous group of contributors. Springfield is lovingly referred to as "The City of Firsts". I picked one of my favorites from that long list of first and illustrated it for my luggage label—the Indian Motorcycle! Sorry basketball, you weren't really on my radar when I got into this project.</p>

					<h3>Bikes Fight Cancer</h3>
					<p>Bikes Fight Cancer is a cycling team dedicated to the fight against cancer. Over the last eight years the team has raised over $138,000 for cancer research via The Pan Mass Challenge. Sparing no expense on fund raising, team jerseys, and other shwag, the team recently decided to invest in their web presence as well. This redesign would focus on providing multiple ways to donate online and documenting all of the hard work these self-proclaimed knuckleheads have put into this noble adventure.</p>

					<h3>Drinks at Upstatement Event & Microsite</h3>
					<p>Upstatement is fortunate to make its home in historic Fort Point Channel. Our 100 year old building houses our studio in a massive, beautiful space. We love hosting parties (everything from poster shows, to holiday parties to inviting the creative community over for drinks) and we love being able to catch up with friends, clients and our contemporaries in Boston. Every season I lead the charge in setting up our "Drinks Upstatement" event. I was also able to make this fun microsite and build out some custom type to help hype these happenings.</p>

					<h3>Upstatement Holiday Card</h3>
					<p>Happy Everything! This is the greeting that marks every Upstatement Holiday Card. This card was illustrated and printed at Upstatement HQ and kicked off what has been a fun Holiday tradition since I joined the team in 2011.</p>

					<h3>The NPR 2013 Tour Book</h3>
					<p>Over its 30 pages this hardcover book documents the origins of The National Poster Retrospecticus, each stop on our first three-week-long tour across the country and covers some of our process as well.</p>
