					<h3>Been Everywhere Project</h3>
					<p>Designer Adrian Walsh curated a collaborative design project called "The Everywhere Project" that pays tribute to the classic folk song “I’ve Been Everywhere”. My birthplace of Springfield Mass is mentioned in the song and I was fortunate enough to represent the city and hang with pretty righteous group of contributors. Springfield is lovingly referred to as "The City of Firsts". I picked one of my favorites from that long list and illustrated it for my luggage label (sorry basketball, I didn't love you as much until a little later)—the Indian Motorcycle! </p>

					<h3>Bikes Fight Cancer</h3>
					<p>Matt Thompson of NPR reached out to Upstatment about developing a simple web site and branding system that could be used for Spark Camp: a thing where people talk and stuff. Even though the project had a limited timeline I was able to jump in, establish a the brand elements and build out a site around this new visual language and Matt's content needs. We were fortunate to work with Matt and his appreciation of all the extra details (like building out a set of icons at our suggestion) ultimately led to NPR hiring Upstatement for several other larger projects.</p>

					<h3>Drinks at Upstatement Microsite</h3>
					<p>This self initiated project took place during my last semester at Mass Art. The goal of the project was to gain more experience drawing letter forms and experiment with screen printing. To prepare for the project I collected 945 letters as research, and built a new screen printing set up that would allow me to print twice as large as in the past. Type was then redrawn from reference, from scratch or left as is because it was so unique, and then screen printed. From start to finish this project took 200+ hours to complete — probably the most time I've spent on any one project to date!</p>
