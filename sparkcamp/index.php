					<h3>Spark Camp</h3>

					<p>Matt Thompson of NPR reached out to Upstatment about developing a simple web site and branding system that could be used for Spark Camp: a thing where people talk and stuff. Even though the project had a limited timeline I was able to jump in, establish a the brand elements and build out a site around this new visual language and Matt's content needs. We were fortunate to work with Matt and his appreciation of all the extra details (like building out a set of icons at our suggestion) ultimately led to NPR hiring Upstatement for several other larger projects.</p>
