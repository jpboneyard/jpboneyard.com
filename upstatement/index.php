					<h1>Designer at Upstatement</h1>
					<p>It feels like the stars aligned when I first met Mike Swartz as my web design teacher in my final semester of Mass Art. Everyone around me was willing to bet that I'd end up doing a lot of branding, poster design, screenprinting and packaging after graduation. Web and interactive work was not in the cards for me. After wrapping up my portfolio site in Mikes Class he asked if I'd be working at <a href="http://www.upstatement.com" target="_blank">Upstatement</a>; a web consultancy here in Boston. The cool part about this invitation is that I'd get a wealth of new experience working on the web and running client projects but I'd also get to do my fair share of the branding, poster, packaging and printmaking work that was in my wheelhouse.</p>

					<h3>Responsive Design for the Web</h3>
					<p>Upstatement is known for its work on responsive sites like BostonGlobe.com. Solving high-level content and organization problems and writing the best code possible is the Upstatement way. While I've worked on dozens of web projects during my time at Upstatement, the first client project that I was able to run, manage, design and do the front-end development for was Upstatement's Alma mater of sorts: Syracuse Universities Independent Student News Paper <a href="http://www.dailyoragen.com" target="_blank">The Daily Orange</a>. The site took visual inspiration from The D.O.'s physical newspaper and implemented a responsive designâ€”something relatively new for college papers at the time. This redesign focused heavily on the backend; using a new CMS to make updaing the site a breeze, and on ad revenue opporunities through out the site. We were able to implement responsive ads, create new types of sponsorship opportunities and allow the paper to swap out house ads and paid ads with ease. In 2012 and again in 2013 our design helped this awesome publication win Best Student Newspaper Website in the world. We still can't beleive it!</p>

					<h3>Design for Print</h3>
					<p>My first love was print design. As much as I love design for the web there's no changing who came first. I'm fortunate to get to use this muscle rather often at Upstatement wheither its designing and screenprinting our holiday cards, designing posters for Upstatement events or designing our business cards and stationary.</p>

					<h3>Brand Manager</h3>
					<p>My responsibilites extened a little further in the print and visual department. Early on I inherited the role of Upstatement's brand manager. This meant I'd help facilitate the look and feel of our image across print and the web. When new business cards need to be designed, I'm on it. When we decide we need stickers, custom table wraps or photos shot for our portfolio, I'm stoked to help out there too. Over all I'm responsible for making Upstatement put its best foot forward in the presentation department.</p>

					<h3>Director of Fun / Bric-a-Brac Department</h3>
					<p>Last but not least my propensity for fun made be a fine candidate to facilitate fun events for the Upstatement team and for public events at our dojo. I also get to spearhead the initiative to make fun stuff whenever the holidays roll around or any other special event comes up. This could mean I'm designing the packaging, bric-a-brac, holiday card and website for a special event or setting up our season <a href="http://www.upstatement.com/drinks" target="_blank">Drinks with Upstatement</a> party for the public.</p>
